# PREDICTIVE-MAINTENANCE-OF-INDUSTRIAL-MACHINERY-USING-MACHINE-LEARNING
Industrial machines are prone to unexpected failures, leading  to costly downtime and inefficiencies. This project aims to  develop a predictive maintenance model that uses data to  identify patterns leading to machine failures such as tool wear,  power failure, and heat dissipation issues.
